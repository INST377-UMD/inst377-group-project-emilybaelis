                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is first and foremost to help pets in Maryland adoption centers, shelters, etc. find their forever homes. As pet lovers ourselves, we know
                    the issues that countrywide adoption websites have, one of them being it's difficult to keep the information up-to-date with every animal. By focusing
                    all of our efforts on Maryland and its pets, our small team can make sure that everything's running smoothly and updated frequently, therefore ensuring
                    that at least the animals in our state will find their future owners and their rightful homes.

                <h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adopting means saving a life, since many animals in shelters have to be euthanized due to room constraints.</li>
                    <li>Adopting is more affordable than buying from a pet store. Plus,</li>
                    <li>Animals from pet stores are usually products of "mills", which are inhumane breeding facilities that prioritize profit over animal welfare.</li>
                    <li>Shelters and rescue groups have history on their animals, knowing their personality, likes, and dislikes.</li>
                    <li>Last but not least, every life deserves a second chance.</li>
                </ul>
