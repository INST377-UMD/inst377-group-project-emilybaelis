Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)
- The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
- They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
- You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.


## Developer Manual
- How to install your application and all dependencies
- How to run your application on a server
- How to run any tests you have written for your software
- We are using the Adopt-a-Pet.com Basic API, and one GET endpoint we are using is /search/pet_search. This endpoint returns a list of pets that match the search. The other GET endpoint we are using is /search/limited_pet_details. This endpoint provides a full list of details about the pet as well as a link to the animal's page on adoptapet.com which can provide the user more details about the aniaml.
- Not all animals have a photo associated with them.
